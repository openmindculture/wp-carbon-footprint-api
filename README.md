# Show Gutenberg Incompatibility Status in WP-Admin

Gutenberg Incompatibility Status adds a status message to the admin dashboard to display possible incompatibility issues using the block editor and full-site editing.

This plugin checks for possible mismatching setups and displays a status in the admin dashboard. Currently checks if a WordPress instance has an active classic editor plugin while using a block theme as the current theme. It also checks and displays the current PHP version. We will check full-site editing vs. incompatible popular plugins in the future.
