# Show Block / Full-Site Editing Incompatibility Status in WP-Admin

Incompatibility Status adds a status message to the admin dashboard to display possible incompatibility issues using the block editor and full-site editing.

This plugin checks for possible mismatching setups and displays a status in the admin dashboard. Currently checks if a WordPress instance has an active classic editor plugin while using a block theme as the current theme. It also checks and displays the current PHP version. We will check full-site editing vs. incompatible popular plugins in the future.

## Development

Follow the [detailled WordPress plugin development guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/).

In JetBrains IDEA (PhpStorm, WebStorm, etc.) enable WordPress support and set `wp_data` as WordPress path, so that the local code inspections like SonarLint can recognize the built-in functions. You can still mark the directory as excluded to avoid unnecessary indexing and search results.

### SVN Release Tags

We use `git` branches and tags for feature development, and `svn` to release to the WordPress plugin directory. So all development is done in `incompatibility-status/trunk`!

To add svn tags, use the `svn` command or create a new symbolic link in the `tags` directory. [Symbolic links are stored as files in git.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/954560/how-does-git-handle-symbolic-links) So we should not add `tags` to `.gitignore`, but we can mark it as an ignored / excluced directory in our IDE to make sure we only edit and search files our `trunk` directory.

```
cd incompatibility-status/tags
ln -s ../trunk 1.0.0
```

Replace `1.0.0` with the new release tag name.

### Verify the Plugin before committing

To verify the release, create an archive file of the tag directory, e.g.

```
cd incompatibility-status/tags
zip incompatibility-status-1.0.0.zip 1.0.0
```

The resulting zip archive file can be uploaded into an existing WordPress instance to verify that it works.

Commit the result to both repositories:

```
git commit -a
git push
git tag "1.0.0"
git push --tags
cd incompatibility-status
svn commit
```

#### Validating the readme file

Run `incompatibility-status/trunk/readme.txt` through the official [WordPress ReadMe Validator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/readme-validator/). Youâ€™ll get notified if there is an error in your file.

### Tag Versions in Git vs. SVN

Development milestones that do not correspond to official releases, should be tagged as subversions (e.g `1.1.1` -> `1.1.2`) only in git, so that we only release major and minor versions in the official WordPress directory svn repository. We could also use suffixes in git, like during a review process, where we have to submit subsequent refined versions of the same target release tag, e.g. `1.0.0-rc3` for the third release candidate of the official `1.0.0` release.
